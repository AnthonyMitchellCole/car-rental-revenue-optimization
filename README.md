# car-rental-revenue-optimization
Model and Dashboard for revenue and structure optimization of a car rental company.

The purpose for this project was to provide insight and recommendations so that a car rental company could optimize net revenue. This was to be done by maximizing gross revenue while minimizing expenditure, as well as simplifying existing structure where possible.

This was done through the analysis of all relevant raw data, so as to get a better picture of possible solutions.

The project was completed using Excel and also paired with a PowerPoint.
Features include the main model and dashboard in Excel, which is split into 3 separate worksheets, and a supplemental PowerPoint to quickly get across the big picture.

Final recommendations based on the data available was to increase branch counts and eliminate dispensable vehicle stock.
